# NutritionalApp
This "app" was designed as a real life scenario with a focus on nutrition. You will see demonstrations for how a user will moderate weigh loss or gain. 
Additionally the app has a database from the web, so that the user may input specific food ate during the day. The output should track the users calories consumed.
